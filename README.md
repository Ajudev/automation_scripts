# Automation Scripts in Python
* Created two scripts one to take screenshot and the other to do different tasks on Skype using pyautogui
* Some of the limitations are as follows:
    - The region for screenshots are fixed to take screenshot of a page in a web browser and the web browser tab should be maximised.
    - Prior to running the script for skype task automation skype should be opened and skype application window should be maximised.
